### Machine learning models for stock market predictions

This experiment provides code done in collaboration with K. Wong,
whilst participating in a competition launched by Kaggle about stock market predictions.
The competition is now closed and documentation is available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction

The project is quite complex, and includes trials with decision trees, feed forward neural networks, 
recurrent neural networks and hyperparameter optimisers.
There is also a feature correlation analysis.
The input data comes in CSV form.

Istructions about how to use the code are to be released.
In the meantime, you may explore neural networks in the "./janestreetKaggle/nn" subfolder, and 
feature analysis in the "./janestreetKaggle/tools" subfolder. 
The input data are in the "./jane-street-market-prediction" subfolder.
