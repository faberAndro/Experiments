### Machine learning models for stock market predictions

This experiment provides code done in collaboration with K. Wong,
in participating in a competition launched by Kaggle about stock market predictions.
The competition is now closed and documentation is available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction

The project is quite complex, and includes trials with decision trees, feed forward neural networks, 
recurrent neural networks and hyperparameter optimisers.
There is also a feature correlation analysis.
The input data comes in csv form.

Istructions about how to use the code are to be released soon.
In the meantime, you may explore neural networks in the "nn" subfolder, 
feature analysis in the "tools" subfolder, and input data in the "jane-street-market-prediction" subfolder.
