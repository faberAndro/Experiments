This small project deals with 3 types of ML algorithms: 
Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines, 
comparing their performance in a sample case, and exploring how their
performance is affected changing their settings and hyperparameters in other cases.

The script ```compares_algos``` uses the scikit learn sample dataset "wine", and
applies the 3 algos to it.
